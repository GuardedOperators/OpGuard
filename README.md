**Spigot:** https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/opguard.23200/

OpGuard is a Spigot plugin that protects against op exploits &amp; malicious plugins. It achieves this by maintaining a
list of verified operators and overriding the Bukkit implementation of /op and /deop with its own command: `/opguard`.

- `v4.x.x` releases target **Java 11**
- `v3.x.x` and prior targeted Java 8
