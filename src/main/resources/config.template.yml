# Remember, before giving anybody op, ask yourself:
# - Do I trust this individual?
# - Is op necessary for what they're doing?
# 
# And before installing a new plugin, ask yourself:
# - Is this from a trusted developer?
# - Does this plugin have positive comments and reviews?
#
# You are the first step in securing your server. 
# Use your head. Trust your gut.
# Stay safe!

# --------------------- #
# OpGuard Configuration #
# --------------------- #

# [Data Lock]
# When enabled, OpGuard will prevent new operators from being adding,
# deny password modifications, and block config reloading.
# The only way to unlock is to disable this option and restart the server.

# Default: false
lock: @(lock | false)

# [Online-Only Op]
# OpGuard will only op players if they're online.
#   - /opguard op <player>

# Default: true
only-op-if-online: @(only-op-if-online | true)

# [Online-Only Deop]
# OpGuard will only deop players if they're online.
#   - /opguard deop <player>
# This option is false by default to avoid circumstances where you're unable
# to deop rogue operators. That way banned operators, for example, can be deop'd.

# Default: false
only-deop-if-online: @(only-deop-if-online | false)

# [Password Management]
# When enabled, the following commands will be accessible in-game (by verified operators):
#   - /opguard password <new password>
#   - /opguard reset <current password>
# Otherwise, only console may manage the password (access the commands above).

# Default: true
manage-password-in-game: @(manage.password-in-game | manage-password-in-game | true)

# [Server Shutdown]
# OpGuard will shut the server down if it is disabled.
# Enable this option if you don't want other plugins to disable OpGuard.

# Default: false
shutdown-on-disable: @(shutdown-on-disable | false)

# [PlugMan]
# If PlugMan is installed, OpGuard will automatically exempt itself from PlugMan.
# This option may be ignored if you don't have PlugMan installed.

# Default: true
exempt-opguard-from-plugman: @(exempt-opguard-from-plugman | true)

# --------------- #
#   Inspections   #
# --------------- #

# [Op List Inspection]
# Duration of time (in ticks) that OpGuard should verify the op list.
# Remember: 20 ticks = 1 second, so 4 ticks = 1/5 of a second.
# This value cannot be negative or zero.

# Default: 4
inspection-interval: @(inspection-interval | 4)

# ['*' Permission Check]
# OpGuard will check for players with the '*' permission node (all permissions).
# If a player has '*' and isn't a verified operator, OpGuard will punish them.

# Default: true
check-permissions: @(check-permissions | true)

# [Player Command Injection]
# OpGuard will inject player commands with a special player object
# that will detect and prevent plugins from setting op.
#
# This may interfere with some commands, but instead of modifying this option, 
# try exempting commands and plugins below.
#
# This feature is very important to the functionality of OpGuard. 
# Disabling it is not recommended. 

# Default: true
inject-player-commands: @(inject-player-commands | true)

# [Player Event Injection]
# OpGuard will inject certain player events with a special player object
# that will detect and prevent plugins from setting op.
#
# This feature is very important to the functionality of OpGuard. 
# Disabling it is not recommended. 

# Default: true
inject-player-events: @(inject-player-events | true)

# [Malicious Plugin Disabling]
# OpGuard will disable plugins that have been caught setting op.
# Plugins in the exempt-plugins list will be ignored (they are allowed to set and remove op).

# Default: true
disable-malicious-plugins-when-caught: @(disable-malicious-plugins-when-caught | true)

# [Malicious Plugin Renaming]
# OpGuard will rename plugin .jar files that have been caught setting op if enabled.
# This will prevent malicious plugins from re-enabling on server restart/reload.
#
# JAR renaming will only occur if the plugin disabling is also enabled. 
# (disable-malicious-plugins-when-caught: true)
# 
# Example scenario:
#   If, for example, the plugin "OpMePlugin" sets op for a player, OpGuard will:
#     - Disable OpMePlugin
#     - Rename OpMePlugin.jar to OpMePlugin.jar.opguard-disabled
#   To reverse plugin renaming, simply delete the ".opguard-disabled" part of the JAR's name.

# Default: true
rename-malicious-plugins-when-caught: @(rename-malicious-plugins-when-caught | true)

# --------------------- #

# A list of plugins exempt from OpGuard's various checks.
# When a plugin is present in the list, OpGuard will:

#   - allow the plugin to set and remove op.
# 
# A server restart is required to apply changes to the exempt-plugins list.
#
# Plugin names must be exact! Names are case sensitive (capitalization matters).
# For example, if you have the plugin "MyAmazingPlugin" installed:
#   - MyAmazingPlugin is valid
#   - myamazingplugin is not valid

# Don't forget to enable the toggle directly above! (enable-exempt-plugins: true)
